# Welcome to COALITION's GitHub Organization

**An accessible milsim gaming community**

COALITION, founded in 2016, began as an 18+ gaming community for ArmA and other milsim games. Over the years, it has grown to include thousands of international players who participate in a variety of multiplayer games such as DayZ, War Thunder, Squad, Reforger, and DCS.

This GitHub is where we maintain our public codebase, supporting mod creators, events, and gaming tools for the COALITION community and beyond. Explore our repositories to discover projects designed to enhance your milsim and multiplayer gaming experience.
